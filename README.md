# Daily-Planner

## Description
I want to create a UI design that is simple and allows the user to quickly understand how things work at a glance. 

The planer displays the current date and time, and an inspirational message. Then it displays the normal working hours, 9-5, in individual divs, with an input box, and save button.

The hour divs are color coded to display different colors for past, present, and future hours.

The user will be able to update the input fields and save them in local storage to view them later.

## Website_Design
The website will be designed in a minimist way, presenting only important information to the user. The website will clearly impress ipon the user on how to save any plans that are made.

## Time_Display
The current date and time will be displayed at the top of the page. The time will update every second.

Additionally, a motivational message is displayed under the time, to encourage the user.

## Hour_Divs
The hour divs are a culmination of the regular 9-5 working hours, an input field, and a save button. Additionally the input fields are colored based on the current time. Input fields in hours less than the current hour will display gray. Input field equal to the current hour will display light blue. Input fields that are greater than the current hour will display green.

Once a user has typed into the fields, they can save their input with the "Save" button for each hour. These are saved in local storage for each button. When the user saves an input and reloads the page, or leaves and comes back, the information they saved will display in the input field.

As I continue this journey and collaborate with more colleagues, I will add their names and contact info to this list.

For now I would like to think UoR Coding Boot camp instructors, John and Greg, and the TA's. As well as my supportive family.
